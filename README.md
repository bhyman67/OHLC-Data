This script will get OHLC data for a given date range. It can grab data for every asset listed in the "active assets" within Alpaca. But the user will be able to specify one asset or a set of assets that they would like data for, as well. 

- List assets
- Make api call per 100 assets..
- â€¦.

Note, this is still a work in progress...
